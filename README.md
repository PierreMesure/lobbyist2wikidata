# Lobbyist2Wikidata

This project is an attempt to add information about Swedish lobbyists on Wikidata. It extracts information from various sources to build a database of lobbyists and matches them with existing Wikidata pages. The resulting data can then be reviewed manually and added with the help of software like OpenRefine.
